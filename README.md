# OS-x86
A simple functional Operating System implemented on top of the Pintos framework for x86 instruction set.

### Dependencies
You will need a machine that supports x86 instruction set. The easiest way to do it is through a Virtual Machine (VM). You can download one such Vagrant VM from [UC Berkeley's CS162 Repo](https://github.com/Berkeley-CS162/vagrant/).
